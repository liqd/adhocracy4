Adhocracy4
==========

A library for building online participation software.
It is maintained and developed by Liquid Democracy e.V. and
heavily relies on the Django web framework.

Examples of using adhocracy4 are [a+](https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy-plus),
[meinBerlin](https://github.com/liqd/a4-meinberlin) and
[Civic Europe](https://github.com/liqd/a4-civic-europe). The first two being
online participation platforms implementing different processes like idea
collections or debates, and the latter using adhocracy4 as the basis for a
transparent idea challenge.

To try it out yourself, best start with [a+][https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy-plus/blob/main/docs/installation_prod.md].
