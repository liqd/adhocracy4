### Changed

- **Breaking Change** The react_comments_async templatetag no longer returns the
  comment categories as a data attribute. The categories are now included in the
  data returned from the comment api endpoint if called with `categories=true`.
  If the templatetag is called with `with_categories=True` and the react comments
  are used they automatically fetch the categories, so no changes are necessary.
