### Added

- add new `PointSerializerMixin` which enables a serializer to correctly save geojson features as GeoDjango
in the database and serialize it back as geojson feature.
- new action verb `publish`, currently used for published projects

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Migrate the point field of the `Project` /
`ProjectLocationMixin` to GeoDjango. This requires the usage of a database with
geospatial support (.e.g spatialite, postgresql with postgis)
- use spatialite as database to support GeoDjango
