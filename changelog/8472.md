### Added

- add new `PointSerializerMixin` which enables a serializer to correctly save geojson features as GeoDjango
in the database and serialize it back as geojson feature.
- add a new cached property `status` to the `Project` model which returns the
status of the project as an integer.

### Changed

- use spatialite as database to support GeoDjango
